# Compinterpreting
Running a perfect programming language requires a perfect compiler to run it. As such, the DreamBerd foundation has devised the next innovation in the field of compiling. The **Transpinterpreter**. 

The Transinterpreter works by interpreting DreamBerd while at the same time transpiling it to JavaScript, maximizing efficiency while staying true to DreamBerd.
